What I learned
In this project, I focused on creating a responsive and visually appealing profile card. Key learnings include:

Using rem units for responsive sizing, making the design adaptable to different screen sizes.
Implementing flexbox for layout and alignment, which simplifies positioning elements.
Applying CSS transitions for smooth hover and focus states.
Hereâ€™s an example of CSS adjustments made to ensure the profile card maintains consistent styling across different devices:

css
Copy code
.profile {
background-color: #1e1e1e;
color: white;
padding: 1.25rem;
border-radius: 0.625rem;
text-align: center;
width: 40rem;
}

.profile img {
width: 7.5rem;
height: 7.5rem;
}

.button {
padding: 0.9375rem 1.875rem;
font-size: 1rem;
width: 12.5rem;
}
Continued Development
I plan to focus on the following areas in future projects:

Further refining responsive design techniques to enhance mobile and tablet experiences.
Exploring advanced CSS features and animations to create more dynamic and engaging UI components.
Improving accessibility to ensure all users have a smooth experience with the website.
